# Interactive simulation of computational MRD

This repository explores a simulation of computational MRD detailed in the review article "Applications of machine learning for immunophenotypic measurable residual disease assessment in acute myeloid leukemia". 

In this review article, we provided an illustrative example of how differences in disease characteristics influence the ability of machine learning models to identify (residual) leukemic cells.

## How to use this repository

The simulation can be altered using an interactive widget implemented in Jupyter notebook.
