# Interactive simulation of computational MRD

This repository explores a simulation of computational MRD detailed in the review article "Applications of machine learning for immunophenotypic measurable residual disease assessment in acute myeloid leukemia". 

In this review article, we provided an illustrative example of how differences in disease characteristics influence the ability of machine learning models to identify (residual) leukemic cells.

## Setting up the simulation on your own machine

The simulation can be altered using an interactive widget implemented in Jupyter notebook.

You don't need to install anything! Just click the button below, which will launch a notebook using Binder.

Sometimes, this may take a while (~5 min.), in other cases, it will start automatically.

**After launching, click on "Run -> Run All Cells" in the top bar.**
